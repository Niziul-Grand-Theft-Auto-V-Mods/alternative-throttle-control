<b>About the mod</b>

Accurate throttle for Aircraft is a mod where we add the possibility to conduct the gradual and smooth increase of throttle of an aircraft using the keyboard.
    
By default, throttle by keyboard is somewhat binary, it's either 100%, or 0% there is no smooth as is found in throttle using joystick.

Currently you can increase the acceleration using <i>Oemplus</i> and decrease it with <i>OemMinus</i>. In the future I plan to add the possibility to choose the key by changing the startup file.
