<p><strong>About the mod</strong></p>

<p>Alternative Throttle Control is a mod where we add the possibility to conduct the gradual and smooth increase of throttle of an aircraft using the keyboard.&nbsp;By default, throttle by keyboard is somewhat binary, it&#39;s either 100%, or 0% there is no smooth as is found in throttle using joystick. Currently you can increase the acceleration using <em>Add&nbsp;</em>and decrease it with <em>None</em>.</p>
